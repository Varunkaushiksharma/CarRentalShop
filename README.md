#Car Rental Shop
Overview
The Car Rental Shop project simulates a car rental system where users can rent cars, view available cars, and manage their rental history. This is a console-based application developed in C++. The project allows you to explore object-oriented programming principles like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Features
View Available Cars: Displays the list of available cars for rent.
Rent a Car: Allows users to rent a car by selecting from the available options.
Return a Car: Allows users to return rented cars and track rental history.
Rental History: Keeps track of all the rented cars and provides users with rental details.
Car Management: Admin functionality to add new cars to the system or remove existing ones.
Technologies Used
C++: The main programming language used for the development of this project.
OOP Principles: The project is structured using object-oriented programming concepts like classes and inheritance to model real-world objects (cars, rentals, etc.).
Setup Instructions
To run the Car Rental Shop project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CarRentalShop.git
2. Compile the Code:
Ensure that you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed on your system. To compile the code, open your terminal in the project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
g++ cars.cpp -o car_rental
3. Run the Program:
After compiling the code, you can run the program using the following command:

bash
Copy code
./car_rental
Usage
Once the program is running, you can interact with the system through the console:

View available cars: Displays a list of cars available for rent.
Rent a car: You can rent a car by selecting it from the list.
Return a car: Once youâ€™ve rented a car, you can return it to the system.
View rental history: Check the rental history and details of all rented cars.
Future Improvements
GUI Integration: Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Database Integration: Store car rental details in a database for persistence.
Payment Integration: Implement payment gateway simulation to process payments for rentals.
User Authentication: Add user authentication and different roles (e.g., Admin, Customer).
